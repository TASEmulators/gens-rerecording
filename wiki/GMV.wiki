#.gmv is the movie capture format of Gens, a Sega Genesis/Megadrive emulator. 

==GMV file format description==
GMV file consists of a 64-byte header and the movie data. 

===Header format:===
 000 16-byte signature and format version: "Gens Movie TEST9"
    00F ASCII-encoded GMV file format version. The most recent is 'A'. (?)
    010 4-byte little-endian unsigned int: rerecord count
    014 ASCII-encoded controller config for player 1. '3' or '6'.
    015 ASCII-encoded controller config for player 2. '3' or '6'.
    016 has some special flags (Version A and up only):
       bit 7 (most significant) Frames per second. 1 for 50 Hz, 0 for 60Hz.
       bit 6 is savestate required. 1 = savestate required.
       bit 5 is 3 player movie. 1 = 3 players, 0 = 2 players.
    018 40-byte zero-terminated ascii movie name string
    040 frame data begins here

Each frame consists of 3 bytes.
Byte 1 defines controller 1, in order from least significant to most significant bit:

  Up, Down, Left, Right, A, B, C, Start

Byte 2 defines controller 2 in the same way.
If the movie is a 3-player movie, byte 3 defines controller 3 in the same way.
If the movie is a 2-player movie, byte 3 defines XYZ-mode for both controllers.

  X, Y, Z, Mode (for controller 1), X, Y, Z, Mode, (for controller 2)

When a bit is set in the controller data, it means button is not pressed. Thus a three byte triplet FF FF FF means nothing is pressed during that particular frame.

The file has no terminator byte or frame count. The number of frames is the <filesize minus 64> divided by 3.

The file format has no means of identifying NTSC/PAL, but the FPS can still be derived from the header.
