---------------------------------
Opening and Building the Project:
---------------------------------

Double-click gens.sln in the Gens folder.

If you have Visual Studio Express:
    You'll be asked which product to use to open the .sln file.  
        Select the C++ version.

If you have Visual Studio [Express] 2010 or newer:
    You'll see the VS Conversion Wizard.  
    Click Next. Select whether or not you want a backup, and click Next.  
        Click Finish. Click Close
    The Conversion Report should show no errors.

First, build in Debug mode:
    Right-click "Solution 'gens' (4 projects)" and select "Build Solution" 
    It should build and in the Output area you should eventually see 
    ========== Build: 4 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========

Next, build in Release mode:
    Change the build configuration from Debug to Release
    Right-click "Solution 'gens' (4 projects)" and select "Build Solution" 
    You should see 
    ========== Build: 2 succeeded, 0 failed, 2 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========

    If you build Release mode first, or use "Rebuild Solution", you should see 
    ========== Build: 4 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========

Note About Visual Studio Express:
---------------------------------

Visual Studio Express does not have a resource editor for .rc files, 
which is how the GUI windows are normally edited.

Here are some 3rd-party resource file editors that may work for you:

http://www.resedit.net/
	
    ResEdit breaks the resource file (Gens.rc) and resources.h, so you need to 
	keep a separate copy of the files and copy your changes over manually.
    You need to give it the include location for windows.h.  Here is an example 
	for on 64-bit Windows 7:
            C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include

Potential Build Errors and Solutions:
-------------------------------------

Error: 
    it complains about ddraw.h missing 
Solution: 
    Install a DirectX SDK
    
Error:
    LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file '.\Debug\pwm.obj'
    LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file '.\Release\pwm.obj'
Solution:
    Build again and this error goes away.

Error:
    Incremental Linker crashes
Solution:
    Build again and it will probably work.

Project Information:
--------------------

Gens uses the Starcream 680x0 library emulation for the genesis and Sega CD
68000 CPU emulation, the core has been customised and optimised for Gens.

Gens project is structured as follow :

- Gens directory contains all gens sources except the CPU cores.
- Main68k directory contains the sources for the main 68000 (genesis 68000).
- Sub68k directory contains the sources for the sub 68000 (Sega CD 68000).
- z80 directory contains the sources for the Z80 cpu (genesis).

For speed reasons, 2 68000 cores are used:
- No context swap required.
- Each core is optimised for its function.

Gens.exe file is normally build in the gens\release directory.
To uses netplay features, Gens requires kailleraclient.dll, the file should be
in the same directory as gens.exe
