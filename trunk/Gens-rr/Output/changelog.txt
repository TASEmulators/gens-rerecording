----------------------------------- FAQ ----------------------------------------

Q: Why my movie doesn't play back correctly ?  It's desyncing.

A: The movie must be played in the same condition it has been recorded.  There are some settings  that are known to affect playback :

	-Rom version
	-Game pad configuration : 6 or 3 buttons ( doesn't affect earlier games)
	-Sound enabled or disable
	-Sound mixing frequency ( 11Khz , 22 Khz or 44Khz).  With NTSC, 44khz is recommended.  With PAL, 22khz and 44khz do fine
	-Battery Backed RAM data

Q: Why my movie played well the first time but not anymore ?

A: It's because of the battery backed ram.  Delete the .srm file.  However, you'll lose your save data !

Q: How do I assign a key to Shift instead of LShift or RShift ?

A: Press both the left shift and right shift keys during key assignment. This process is the same for Control, Alt, and Win keys, as well.
